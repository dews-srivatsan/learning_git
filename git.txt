Git is a distributed version control system, which tracks changes in computer files, primarily used for coordinating development work by the programmers during software development process

git --version
git config --global user.name "srivatsan"
git config --global user.gmail "srivatsan@techdew.com"
create a repo = git init
status of repo = git status
to stage a file = git add filename.extension
to stage every files in the folder = git add .
to commit the staged files = git commit -m "commited files" (-m flag -> message)



git repo:
A place where git tracks everything in our project
master is the default branch name created by git

NOTES:
after adding a file(staging) we need to commit it so it is like a screenshot of the file at that point which helps us to track the file 
now if u check the status we can find that readme.md file we not be there and others will be shown now each time we cant able to 
commit each and every files to avoid we use git add . which will stage every file now
